This repository contains the prototype of the No Code Scraper. In order to run it, please use the requirements.txt found inside the prototype folder. You will need to rebuild the TIE model by yourself. simply clone my fork into the root directory of the prototype (found here: https://github.com/Jostafarr/TIE_german_evaluation). I sent you the link to the checkpoint per mail. Just copy it to the checkpoints directory. 

For testing out the prototype locally, check out the streamlit documentary. Also, please run the local webpage on a python webserver. If you have any more questions on how to run the code, don't hesitate to reach out to me.
